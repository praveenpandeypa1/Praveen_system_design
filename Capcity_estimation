Capacity estimation: it is basicallymeans what the amount of infrastructre the system requre means bandwidth , servers, database to get all these estmation we call it is capacity estimatin:

there is some formula and step to calculate the capacity estimation of the given system:

Eg: we are taking google as an example to calculate the capacity:

step 1: Estimate traffic
google has on an avg 5 billion search per day globally:
 so RPS(Request per second)=total search/ total second in one day: 5,000,000,000/86,400= 57,870

 peak factor: 3* average
 peak RPS: 3*57,870=173,610

step2:=estimate resource usage per second:

eg sop=50ms , RAM=10mb, Network: 0.5 mutable

step3: estimate server capacity:
suppone one google search can handle 1000 search per second:

step 4:
server need=173,610/1000=174 peak rops/perserver request
add buffer of 30% failure and many ore so it will 225 instad of 174


step 5: one search=0.5 mb 
173,610*0.5=86GB 

so this is the way of capacity estimation and i have solved it using by looking at one example next you know better:
